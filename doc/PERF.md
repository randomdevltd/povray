# Performance

What this fork changes to make large scenes trace faster, how it was measured, and what is left.

## Results

Measured on a 4-vCPU AMD EPYC Genoa VM (Ubuntu 26.04, GCC 15) with `tools/bench`: user-space cycles of a render
at `+WT4`, minus a 1-pixel render of the same scene, so tracing and parsing separate. Medians of two to four
repeats; repeats agree within 2%. The reference is Ubuntu's packaged POV-Ray 3.7.0.10.

**A large private scene**: 74 thousand finite objects (meshes of up to millions of triangles, height fields, sphere
sweeps, blobs), 13 lights, a 1854×85-pixel band, no anti-aliasing. Shadow rays are 97% of all rays.

| Build | Trace Gcycles | vs 3.7 | Parse Gcycles | Peak memory |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Ubuntu 3.7.0.10 | TRACE37 | — | PARSE37 | RSS37 MB |
| upstream 3.8 master + cpuid and queue fixes | TRACEBASE | VSBASE | PARSEBASE | RSSBASE MB |
| this branch | TRACEBR | VSBR | PARSEBR | RSSBR MB |
| this branch, PGO | TRACEPGO | VSPGO | PARSEPGO | RSSPGO MB |

**The standard benchmark scene** (3.7's `benchmark.pov`, 384×384, its own `benchmark.ini`), where noise, media and
isosurfaces dominate and bounding barely registers:

PUBLICTABLE

Single-threaded renders repeat bit for bit. Against 3.8 master this branch changes about 0.2% of pixels by a few
levels: rays that meet the shared edge of two triangles get the same depth from both, and which one supplies the
normal depends on the order they are tested in. Compiler flags alone (PGO) change as many.

## Where the time went

A cycle profile of 3.8 on the large scene put about 70% of tracing in the bounding hierarchy: `Check_And_Enqueue`
(box test and priority-queue insert, 36% of the whole run), `RemoveMin`, `Intersect_BBox_Tree`, and the same code
walking each mesh's own tree. Box tests ran at 4.9e9 for the band, against 2.9e9 for 3.7.

3.7 split on the axis where boxes' lower corners spread (a bug in `find_axis`); 3.8 fixed it to use extents
(`c52c176d`), which on this scene built a tree needing 70% more box tests.

## Changes

| Change | Effect on the large scene |
|---|---|
| cpuid `"memory"` clobber (`2cb3ed7e`) | GCC dropped the cpuid stores from -O2: AMD CPUs got portable noise |
| AVX2/FMA3 noise on any CPU with it (`050ac7c7`) | 1–3% |
| sphere-sweep scratch buffers per thread (`b7b6ad32`) | under 0.5% |
| EdgeOfAssembly's queue fixes (`d706eb11`, `c62ff4bb`) | not measured separately |
| exact surface-area split over all three axes, not one axis chosen by extent | −20% trace, −44% box tests |
| each pass sorted once, splits kept by stable partition | parse faster than 3.7 with the exact split |
| flattened trees: eight child boxes per block, tested together in single precision, walked with a stack | −39% trace |
| shadow rays stop at the first opaque hit | −12% trace |
| blocks filled by opening the largest child nodes; leaves tested as soon as nothing nearer waits | −7% trace |
| mesh pointer trees freed once flattened | −30% peak memory |
| boxes beyond the best hit so far never queued (the pointer-tree path) | small |
| PGO | about −10% trace |

## Method

`tools/bench/pcount.c` counts user-space instructions, cycles and branch misses of a process and every thread it
starts, through `perf_event_open`; it needs `kernel.perf_event_paranoid` of 2 or less. Cycles count only while
POV-Ray runs, so other load on the machine barely moves them, and instruction counts repeat to 0.01%.
`tools/bench/bench.sh` subtracts a 1-pixel render so parse and trace separate.

Profiles came from `perf record -e cycles:u` on unstripped builds (`--disable-strip`, `-g`).

## Container

    podman build -f unix/Containerfile -t povray .
    podman run --rm -v "$PWD:/work" povray +Iscene.pov +W800 +H600

Build arguments: `MARCH` and `MTUNE` (default `native`; `MARCH=x86-64-v3 MTUNE=generic` runs on any AVX2 CPU),
`PGO` (default 1: trains on the standard benchmark scene before the final build), `BASE` (the Ubuntu image).
`-ffast-math` needs `-fno-finite-math-only` after it or some intersections break.

## Next

- Noise: 55% of the standard benchmark; AVX-512 or a vectorised octave loop.
- Triangles: test a block's triangle leaves eight at a time.
- Height fields: 5% of the large scene in their own block walk.
- A multi-occluder shadow cache saved 3% but changed shadows in ways not yet explained; it is not in this branch.
